Hola, welcome you to my first project. 
This project is very, very simple. It can help and support users find & buy a book. It is rather easy to use, doesn’t take more time to discover. It has a few features. For example, manager can add, edit or delete any product from admin panel. Project has a shopping cart that save customer’s session. 
It's ok. But don't care about it. It just provided for my employer to review my skill. Oops.
